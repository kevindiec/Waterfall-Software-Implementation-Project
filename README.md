# Waterfall Software Implementation Project
The task for this project was to initiate, plan, execute, monitor and close a Asana Software Implementation project utilizing Waterfall Methodology.  The project aims to implement Asana as the enterprise project management tool to resolve problems associated wit the lack of a common project management tool.


# Artifacts
All these artifacts were created utilizing the Asana software to demonstrate how to lead a Software Implementation Project from start to finish. All these pages were created by the Asana Project Management software to illustrate how to fully manage a software implementation project from start to end through the different phases of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and closing.

The project required my team member and I to rotate as Project Managers to ensure the successful implementation of the Asana Software. This project was one of the assignments in the Technical Project Manager course that I was enrolled in. We were able to accomplish the goal utilizing the Asana software and created a presentation in which we were able to justify our choice to our cohort.
